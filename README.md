# Roblox-proxy
Originally part of https://github.com/dragmine149/ETOH, moved to it's own separate repo as it had less and less to do with EToH in general and more to do with roblox.

## Features and anything else
Just visit the proxy here: https://roblox-proxy.dragmine149.workers.dev/.

## Notes
- Sometimes roblox is annoying, if the proxy errors just attempt again and it will most likely succeed (unless the error is a user-error and not a roblox one)
- This doesn't have all the endpoints roblox has, and it also has more endpoints that roblox doesn't have. The amount of endpoints and their usages will change overtime depending on needs of the users.
